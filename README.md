# fast-jev-compaction

Claude Code plugin that replaces the compaction summary with Jev decisions.
The newest turns stay verbatim, every older tool call and result is scored by
[Jev](https://typesafe.ai) in one fast request and kept or cut accordingly,
host notices are trimmed, and old prose can be condensed into a digest.

On a replay of real sessions, `oldProse: digest` with `recentTurns: 8` versus
the default `keep` took the post-compaction floor from about 155k to about 39k
tokens, the growth per compaction from +21k to −5k, and the lost-and-needed
rate from 1.0% to 1.7%. `oldProse` still defaults to `keep`; set it to
`digest` to opt in (see [Configure](#configure)).

## Install

Function hooks are an early-access Claude Code feature (2.1.274+). Set the
flag and your key where Claude Code runs, e.g. in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{ "env": { "CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_FUNCTION_HOOKS": "1", "TYPESAFE_API_KEY": "<your key>" } }
```

```sh
claude plugin marketplace add QuanticPotatoes/fast-jev-compaction
claude plugin install fast-jev-compaction@quanticpotatoes
```

Restart Claude Code or run `/reload-plugins`. `/compact` and auto-compaction
now go through Jev; a toast reports the outcome (`kept N/M messages, no
summary`, `fallback to built-in summary`, or `not compacted`).

**Updating.** Claude Code updates a plugin only when its version changes.
Set `autoUpdate: true` on the marketplace entry, or run
`claude plugin marketplace update quanticpotatoes`.

To try it from a checkout: `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_FUNCTION_HOOKS=1 claude --plugin-dir .`

## Configure

Options are asked at install time and live under `pluginConfigs`. The ones most
people touch:

```json
{
  "pluginConfigs": {
    "fast-jev-compaction@quanticpotatoes": {
      "options": {
        "compactAtPercent": 60,
        "oldProse": "digest",
        "recentTurns": 8,
        "builtinFallback": "auto"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

| Option | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `compactAtPercent` | `60` | Context percentage at which the plugin asks for a compaction |
| `oldProse` | `keep` | Prose older than `recentTurns` user turns: `keep` verbatim, `digest` (offline, deterministic) or `summarize` (written by `proseModel`) |
| `recentTurns` | `8` | User turns kept outside the digest or summary |
| `builtinFallback` | `auto` | Which compactions fall back to Claude Code's built-in summary when Jev fails or frees too little: `auto` (only its own automatic one), `always`, `never`. Use `always` if Claude Code's own autoCompact is disabled, so `/compact` and plugin requests still get a summary |
| `targetPercent` | `45` | Gives up the Jev result if the estimated context after compaction would still exceed this percentage |
| `minReductionRatio` | `0.25` | Minimum estimated reduction required to replace the history |
| `keepMode` | `rank` | `rank` keeps the best-scored calls within `keepResultTokens` / `keepCallTokens`; `threshold` uses `keepThreshold` |
| `preserveRecentMessages` | `6` | Newest messages never touched |

Every option, with its default, is listed in [hooks/README.md](hooks/README.md#configuration).

## How it works

```
history ─┬─ first + newest messages ─────────────── pinned, verbatim
         ├─ tool calls ── Jev scores each call and result
         │                 ├─ best results, within keepResultTokens ─ kept verbatim
         │                 ├─ best calls, within keepCallTokens ──── input + truncated result
         │                 └─ the rest ───────────────────────────── stub note (dropCalls: false)
         ├─ host notices (<system-reminder>, hook output, …) ──────── cut to a short head
         └─ prose older than recentTurns ─ keep | digest | summarize
              ▼
   reduction < minReductionRatio, or estimated floor > targetPercent
              └─▶ builtinFallback: built-in summary, or leave history unchanged
```

Jev scores are compressed (`keepCall` rarely exceeds 0.3), so the default
`rank` mode ranks calls instead of using an absolute threshold. Jev sees the
whole conversation with tool outputs replaced by a one-line note, fitted into
`maxStateTokens`. Your own prose is kept verbatim unless you opt into
`oldProse`; only tool calls, tool results and host-generated notices are cut.
The full algorithm is in [docs/library.md](docs/library.md#algorithm-in-detail).

## Why this fork

Lineage: [tamaratran/fast-jev-compaction](https://github.com/tamaratran/fast-jev-compaction)
(upstream, frozen since 2026-09-17 with about 60 unmerged PRs) →
[ferrisworks/fast-jev-compaction](https://github.com/ferrisworks/fast-jev-compaction)
(integration fork that merged about 13 of them) → this fork. Thanks to both.
Compared with them, this fork adds:

- **Rank-based keeping.** Measured on 4,603 decisions over 60 sessions,
  `keepCall` was about 0.1–0.3 (max 0.58), so the absolute 0.5 threshold kept 0
  calls (upstream issues [#56](https://github.com/tamaratran/fast-jev-compaction/issues/56),
  [#26](https://github.com/tamaratran/fast-jev-compaction/issues/26),
  [#52](https://github.com/tamaratran/fast-jev-compaction/issues/52)).
- **`targetPercent`.** Because all message text was kept, the floor rose with
  each compaction (reduction 77% → 30% within one session; upstream issue
  [#70](https://github.com/tamaratran/fast-jev-compaction/issues/70) reports
  36K → 87K tokens over 6 rounds).
- **Host-text trimming** (`trimHostText`): notices were about 54% of the
  retained "user" text per issue #70 (idea from upstream PR
  [#78](https://github.com/tamaratran/fast-jev-compaction/pull/78)).
- **Prose digest and summary** (`oldProse`).
- **Robustness from ferrisworks:** secret redaction
  ([#98](https://github.com/tamaratran/fast-jev-compaction/pull/98)), subagent and
  speculative compactions skipped
  ([#112](https://github.com/tamaratran/fast-jev-compaction/pull/112)),
  code-point-safe truncation
  ([#110](https://github.com/tamaratran/fast-jev-compaction/pull/110)), Jev wait
  bound ([#117](https://github.com/tamaratran/fast-jev-compaction/pull/117)),
  auto-only built-in fallback
  ([#103](https://github.com/tamaratran/fast-jev-compaction/pull/103)), plus
  headless-session and surrogate-pair tests (upstream PRs
  [#125](https://github.com/tamaratran/fast-jev-compaction/pull/125),
  [#132](https://github.com/tamaratran/fast-jev-compaction/pull/132)).
- **CI and versioned releases**; see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

| | upstream 0.3.0 | ferrisworks 0.5.4 | this fork |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tool calls kept | Absolute 0.5 threshold | Same | Rank within token budgets |
| Dropped calls | Deleted | Stub note | Stub note |
| Size guard | Min 25% reduction | Same | Same + `targetPercent` |
| Built-in fallback | Always | Automatic compactions only | Same |
| Secret redaction | No | Yes | Yes |
| Host notices / old prose | Kept | Kept | Trimmed / optional digest |
| CI and releases | No | No | Yes |

Roadmap: fact salvage on dropped calls (upstream issues
[#118](https://github.com/tamaratran/fast-jev-compaction/issues/118),
[#105](https://github.com/tamaratran/fast-jev-compaction/issues/105)).

## Measuring

`tools/replay` replays recorded sessions offline under different policies and
reports reduction, post-compaction floor, growth per compaction and a
lost-and-needed rate. See [tools/replay/README.md](tools/replay/README.md).
The evidence is limited: lost-and-needed is a token-reuse proxy computed
offline, not a measure of task success.

## Library, development, demo

The package is usable without Claude Code (`compactMessages`, your own
`JevAsker`, the building blocks): see [docs/library.md](docs/library.md).

```sh
npm install
npm run typecheck        # library + hook
npm test                 # fake Jev, no network
npm run test:hooks:host  # native hook dispatcher tests; requires Claude Code
npm run build
npm run validate:plugin  # claude plugin validate
TYPESAFE_API_KEY="$(cat ~/.typesafe_key)" npm run demo   # live network check
```

`demo/JevDemo` is a native SwiftUI app (macOS) that plays a scripted,
dramatized compaction for screen recording; it never calls the API.
`demo/JevDemo/build.sh` builds and launches it; space replays.
